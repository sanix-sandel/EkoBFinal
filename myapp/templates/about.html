                  polytechnic university, Peter the great. As child, I always dreamed building websites even though 
                I have no clue about programming. As I discovered how websites are built, so I dared and...it worked !
                  just a childohood's passion, but I'm not a web developper, just a passion. I aspire to become 
            a data scientist one day. <br/> Ozui nga bien ?</p>
